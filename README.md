Task 1 focused on predicting restaurant aggregate ratings using regression models. After **data preprocessing and EDA**, outliers were removed using the **IQR method**, and binary transformation was applied. The target variable (`y`) was set as **aggregate ratings**, and models like **XGBoost Regressor** and **HistGradientBoosting Regressor** were tested. Feature selection was performed using **Permutation Feature Importance, Correlation, and Mutual Information Score**, followed by **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance. The **HistGradientBoosting Regressor** achieved **82% accuracy**, making it the best model for predicting restaurant ratings.
Task 2 focused on building a **restaurant recommendation system** using multiple approaches, including **Cosine Similarity, Collaborative Filtering, Hybrid Methods, and K-Means Clustering**. The system recommends restaurants based on factors like **price range, average cost for two, aggregate rating, votes, city, and geolocation**. By leveraging clustering techniques and similarity measures, the model efficiently provides personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience in selecting restaurants.
Task 3 aimed to classify **restaurant cuisines** and predict cuisine types using **XGBoost and HistGradientBoosting** models. Performance was evaluated using **accuracy and classification reports**, but the results were poor due to **inconsistent samples across cuisines and unsuitable encoding for ML models**. The dataset's complexity suggests that **deep learning approaches like ANN** could better capture patterns and improve classification accuracy.
### **Task 4: Geolocation-Based Restaurant Hub Analysis**  

Task 4 focused on identifying **popular restaurant hubs** using **geolocation data**. **DBSCAN and K-Means clustering** were applied to analyze the **global distribution of restaurants**, revealing dense clusters and isolated areas. Interactive **maps and correlation heatmaps** helped visualize restaurant density and spatial patterns, providing insights into key dining hotspots worldwide.
